    <h1>Hardiness Zone Finder</h1>
    <div class='descriptionContainer'>
    <p>The USDA divides North America into 11 separate growing (hardiness) zones;
     each zone is 10Â°F warmer - or colder - in an average winter than the adjacent zone. 
     Knowing your growing zone allows you to estimate your first and last frosts so that 
     you can better gauge when to start your seeds and plant outside. Additionally, it can 
     help you determine the best plants and varieties to grow in your backyard.</p>
