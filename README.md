### What is a Growing Zone?
A growing zone is the national standard for knowing which plants will grow in a location. The USDA divides North America into 11 growing (hardiness) zones; each zone is 10Â°F warmer - or colder - in an average winter than the adjacent zone. Knowing your growing zone is vital to successful gardening, as it gives you the corresponding information to estimate the first and last frost dates of your location and plan when to start your seeds and plant your seedlings outside, as well as the information needed to know which plants will thrive in your region.

### The Tutorial
Whether or not you have a greenthumb, this growing zone finder is an excellent project for beginning programmers looking to become more familiar with inputs, APIs, and JavaScript.
